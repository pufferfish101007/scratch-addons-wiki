**Thanks for being interested on volunteering to translate Scratch Addons to other languages!**

Scratch Addons is a non-profit open source project where volunteer web developers maintain the extension and create its addons. Even if you haven't ever coded a single line of JavaScript, you can still help us achieve our goal of making everyone's experience with Scratch better! All you need to do is know another language, and spend a few minutes a week translating any new words or sentences Scratch Addons might have added during that period, so that anyone that speaks that language can use Scratch Addons in their native language, instead of having to understand English.

If you're interested in helping, please follow these steps:

- Create a free [Transifex](https://transifex.com/) account. Don't enter your real name; it will be public.
- [Make your Transifex account Public](https://docs.transifex.com/account/managing-public-profile).
- Create a GitHub account if you haven't yet, no need to use your real name either.
- Go to the "[Want to Translate?](https://github.com/ScratchAddons/ScratchAddons/discussions/1052)" post.
- Post your username on Transifex and the language you want to translate to.

Notes:

- Scratch must be translated in that language.
- It may take a few days before your request is accepted.
- If you get accepted you'll get added to the [website's contributors page](https://scratchaddons.com/contributors)

**If you have any questions about translating, feel free to [open a discussion](https://github.com/ScratchAddons/ScratchAddons/discussions) (GitHub account required) or [send feedback](https://scratchaddons.com/feedback) (no account required, but make sure to specify your Scratch username).**
